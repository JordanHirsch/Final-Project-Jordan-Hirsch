## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

- Directory & file path confusion: Running node test-connection.js in the wrong folder, missing or mis-named files, mis-imported modules in models/index.js.

- Database setup hiccups: “Unknown database” errors until we aligned our .env and MySQL Workbench settings.

- 404/“Cannot GET/POST /api/posts”: Express routes not matching due to wrong base URL or missing authentication middleware.

- JWT/token woes: Invalid/malformed signature errors when signing/verifying tokens, forgetting to attach the Authorization header, then hard-coding full URLs bypassing axios.defaults.

- Upvote logic: Needed to enforce one-click toggle (add/remove) rather than unlimited increments.

- Comment-posting failures: Hard-coded localhost calls bypassed baseURL and JWT, leading to 401/404 until switched to relative /api paths.

- Tailwind/PostCSS build errors: Mis-configured plugin usage, missing @tailwindcss/postcss, causing build failures.

- Background image loading: Webpack couldn’t resolve assets in public/ from CSS, requiring moving the image into src/assets/.

- NavBar state: Logout button only showing on hover or not at all until we derived isLoggedIn fresh from localStorage and unified menu-item styling.

- Styling iterations: Switching in custom fonts, gym-themed colors, light/dark experiments, then rolling back to stable CSS.
